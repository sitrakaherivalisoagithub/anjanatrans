- Background color: A light gray (#F0F4F8), a desaturated hue of the primary blue, ensuring readability and a clean interface.
- Accent color: A bright yellow (#FFC72C), analogous to blue, mirroring the stripes in the logo to highlight important calls to action.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headers and short body text; 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for longer blocks of text.
- Use simple and clear icons related to transportation and logistics for the services section.
- Maintain a clean, well-spaced layout to enhance readability and user experience.
- Subtle animations (e.g., fade-ins) when transitioning between sections or on button hover to add a touch of interactivity.
